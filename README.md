# Python & Linux Foundations

This repository documents my hands-on practice in Python and Linux.

The goal is to build strong foundations through small scripts,
documentation, and practical exercises focused on real-world usage.

Topics include:
- Python basics and scripting
- Linux fundamentals
- Bash scripting
- Version control with Git

This repository is updated continuously as part of my daily learning process.
