# Linux Users and Groups

Linux is a multi-user operating system where access
to files and resources is controlled by users and groups.

## Users
Each user has a unique ID and a home directory.
The root user has full administrative privileges.

## Groups
Groups are used to manage permissions for multiple users.
A user can belong to one or more groups.

## Relation to Permissions
File permissions are applied to:
- the file owner (user)
- the group
- others

This mechanism allows flexible and secure access control.
