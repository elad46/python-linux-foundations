# sudo and root in Linux

The root user has full administrative access to the system.

For security reasons, daily work is performed as a regular user.
Administrative tasks are executed using sudo when required.

## sudo
sudo allows a permitted user to execute a command
with superuser privileges in a controlled way.

## Best Practice
Using sudo instead of logging in as root
reduces the risk of accidental system damage.
